- [Live Demo](https://infinite-island-27570.herokuapp.com/)

An online mood journal that is displayed on a calendar.

## Motivation

When I was exiting out of depression, I wrote a lot when I was feeling down or happy. These important events allowed me to be more self-aware of why I was feeling specific emotions and allowed myself to correct my own actions or steer away from certain things. By having a mood journal to write and store in, I'm able to see and track my moods throughout the months and be more self-aware.

## Future Feature Implementations

Mood Tracker - Calculates how many times you have felt for each emotion per month
Mood Common Demoninator - Figures out the most common words said per emotion to find any common themes
